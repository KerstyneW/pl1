  <h1> Shark sightings along the False Bay Coastline</h1>  
  <p> As part of my Web GIS Development course at Fleming college I was required to complete a
    <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/outreach/learn/visualize-your-data-on-a-custom-map-using-google-my-maps/">Google My Maps</a> 
    introductory tutorial. The tutorial provided step-by-step instructions to create the following map which shows shark sightings at different
    beaches along the False Bay Coastline in South Africa. </p>
  <p> The data provided to complete the tutorial was courtesy of 
    <a href="https://sharkspotters.org.za/safety/shark-sightings/">Shark Spotters</a> and the MAPA Project. </p>
